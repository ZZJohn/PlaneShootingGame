This is a plane shooting game in Python. The original version is from Shiyanlou (https://www.shiyanlou.com/courses/49) and its code is original_game.py. I also used their resources including images and fonts.

I made some modification on the original Python code and add some new features. mygame.py is my version. I learned the basic idea of implementing games and Python pygame package from this project.
